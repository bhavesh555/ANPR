# ANPR
Automatic Number Plate Detection (ANPR) is a 
computer vision technology that uses image processing 
techniques to identify and extract license plate information 
from images or videos captured by cameras. ANPR has 
become increasingly popular in recent years due to its 
applications in various domains, such as traffic management, 
parking management, law enforcement, and toll collection 
systems. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a 
popular open-source library for computer vision and image 
processing that provides a range of tools and algorithms to 
implement ANPR systems. By leveraging OpenCV, 
developers can create ANPR systems that are accurate, 
efficient, and robust, capable of processing large volumes of 
images or videos in real-time. In this context, the integration 
of ANPR with OpenCV has become a widely adopted 
approach for license plate detection and recognition, offering 
numerous benefits for various industries and applications..
